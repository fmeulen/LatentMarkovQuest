# LatentMarkovQuest

Julia based implementation of a latent Markov model for analysing questionnaire data. 
WIP
The present implementation is merely meant to play around with Turing.jl for obtaining an efficient algorithm for a model similar to that proposed in 


In this implementation, the likelihood is computed from the backward information filter and latent states are marginalised out.
